# String Replacer NPM Package

Put in a string and get back a string without the spaces!

All you need to do is call the function stringReplacer with an argument including your string:

`stringReplacer(yourString)`

I have also published this module on the NPM registry too.

Visit [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jameslevine/npmpackage) to see the package live on the NPM registry.

To install the package, run `npm i @jameslevine/npmpackage`.

Enjoy!
